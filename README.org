* About
This is a test game written in ~godotclj~ (that was initially written in ~ArcadiaGodot~).

* Installation and Running
Install:
#+begin_src bash
  mkdir lib
  curl -L https://github.com/tristanstraub/godotclj/releases/download/v0.0.5/godotclj.jar -o lib/godotclj.jar
#+end_src

Run:
#+begin_src bash
  # Import assets (only needs to be run once)
  clj -M -e "(require 'godotclj.runner) (godotclj.runner/start \"--editor\" \"--quit\")"

  # Run the game
  clj -M -e "(require 'godotclj.runner) (godotclj.runner/start \"-v\")"
#+end_src
* Bugs
Whenever ~.connect~ is used this error is thrown:
#+begin_src
class godotclj.api.InstanceGc cannot be cast to class java.lang.Number (godotclj.api.InstanceGc is in unnamed module of loader 'app'; java.lang.Number is in module java.base of loader 'bootstrap'
#+end_src

This does not affect the game, although it can be a bit unwieldy to debug given how long the stack traces are.
