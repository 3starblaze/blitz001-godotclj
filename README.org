* About
This is a test game written in ~godotclj~ (that was initially written in ~ArcadiaGodot~).

* Installation and Running
Install:
#+begin_src bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
make
#+end_src

Run:
#+begin_src bash
./godotclj/scripts/godot.sh
#+end_src
* Bugs
Whenever ~.connect~ is used this error is thrown:
#+begin_src
class godotclj.api.InstanceGc cannot be cast to class java.lang.Number (godotclj.api.InstanceGc is in unnamed module of loader 'app'; java.lang.Number is in module java.base of loader 'bootstrap'
#+end_src

This does not affect the game, although it can be a bit unwieldy to debug given how long the stack traces are.
